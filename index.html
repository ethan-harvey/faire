  <h1 class="title">Ye Olde Faire</h1>

  <blockquote class="hook">
    <p>Every year, performers, vendors, re-enactors, and eccentrics converge on this run-down park for a celebration of dubious history, feats of strength and skill, fairy-tale nonsense, and terrible puns. Jousters knock each other flying from their horses. Siege weapons fling pumpkins into the air. Hastily made stages wobble beneath duels and belly dancers. Knife vendors flirt with everyone who walks by. The people in garb hand-woven from period materials grouse about the people running around with plastic fairy wings. It’s a chaotic, colorful mess, and you do it every year because at least some part of you loves it.</p>
    <p>But the <em>real</em> drama happens after hours, when you and the rest of the staff are free to argue, gossip, hook up, and plot revenge for that prank they played on you three years ago. You have a few weeks to cram in a year’s worth of shenanigans with these people, so make the most of it.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is an add-on for playing Unincorporated as the staff and volunteers at a Renaissance fair instead of the default small town. You’ll need the original game, which you can download at <a href="https://ethanharvey.itch.io/unincorporated" title="Unincorporated itch.io page">ethanharvey.itch.io/unincorporated</a>. You can replace the original <a href="#Questions">Questions</a>, <a href="#Plots">Plots</a>, and <a href="#Examples">Examples</a> with the ones in this playbook or combine them for more variety. It’s designed to play over one or two sessions. If you want to play a longer campaign, you’ll probably need to add Plots from the original game, or make up your own.</p>

  <h4>Some tips for this setting:</h4>
  <ul class="list-paragraphs">
    <li>
      Characters could be any mix of traveling vendors; professional performers; locals from schools, museums, bands, and theater and dance clubs; LARP and Society for Creative Anachronism groups; and municipal employees.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you’re having trouble coming up with a name for an attraction, business, or performer, you can never go wrong with dad jokes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don’t worry about historical accuracy. While some groups do try to educate visitors about life in historical periods and you’ll find that one guy who’ll show you how to make your own loom from period-accurate materials, Renaissance fairs are mostly about light-hearted depictions of “the past.” Combine <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> and Disney’s <em>Robin Hood</em> cartoon and you’ve got the right vibe.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Plots</h2>
    <ul class="list-plots">
      <li>
        <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> has challenged you to a boffer duel at <span class="placeholder">Place</span>. Winner gets <span class="placeholder">Thing</span> and, more importantly, bragging rights. You can win if you cheat, but you can’t let your <span class="placeholder">(boss|relative|crush)</span>, <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span>, find out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span>, a stickler for historical accuracy, has banned phones from <span class="placeholder">Place</span>. You need to be there, but you’re waiting for an important call from <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> broke <span class="placeholder">Thing</span>, but you took the blame. Every day since then, <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span> has made sure you get stuck being the human archery target. <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> will admit it was their fault, if you do them a favor…
      </li>
      <li>
        You didn’t recognize your <span class="placeholder">(ex|relative|frenemy)</span>, <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> in their plague doctor costume, watching you make a complete fool of yourself last night at <span class="placeholder">Place</span>. They recorded it all. You just know they’re going to show it to <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span>, your <span class="placeholder">(crush/mentor/boss)</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your hasty repair of <span class="placeholder">Thing&nbsp;or&nbsp;Place</span> is failing. Someone could get hurt if you don’t fix it soon, but you need to get everyone out of there first, and <span class="placeholder">Person</span> won’t shut it down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> got their fortune told by <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span>, who told them something terrible would happen to them while they were alone. Now <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> is following you everywhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        You haven’t seen <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> since last year’s Faire, but you haven’t been able to get them out of your mind. This year they’re working at <span class="placeholder">Place</span>. Unfortunately, <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span> is also flirting with them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some regular visitors always heckle <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> at their show. <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> doesn’t care, but they’ve finally talked <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span> into performing with them. They want you to keep the hecklers away today. But you need to be across the park at <span class="placeholder">Place</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="placeholder">Person</span> entrusted <span class="placeholder">Thing</span> to you while they went into town. But you’ve lost it. You last saw it at <span class="placeholder">Place</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hiding <span class="placeholder">Thing</span> in someone’s vehicle, tent, or booth has become a tradition. You’ve bet <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;1</span> you can sneak it into <span class="placeholder">Place</span> for <span class="placeholder">Person&nbsp;2</span> to find. Good luck.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="placeholder">Person</span>, whom you want to impress, needs your help at <span class="placeholder">Place</span>. Unfortunately, you have a phobia of <span class="placeholder">Things</span>, and there will be lots of them there.

    <h2>Note to Players</h2>

    <p>This is a beta version. The <a href="https://ethanharvey.itch.io/unincorporated" title="Unincorporated itch.io page">basic system</a> has been extensively playtested, but this particular setting has only been played a few times.</p>
    <p>I’d love to hear feedback. Especially if you have a lot of experience with Renaissance fairs and think I got something wrong, or if you have <em>no</em> experience with Renaissance fairs and were confused about something.</p>
    <p>You can leave a comment on the project page at <a href="https://ethanharvey.itch.io/faire">ethanharvey.itch.io/faire</a> or message me on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/byEthanHarvey">@byEthanHarvey</a>) or Mastodon (<a href="https://dice.camp/@cavedueller">@cavedueller@dice.camp</a>).</p>
